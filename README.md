- If you do use it, let me know and [I'll help you promote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/spaceagente)

## Preparing NFTs

## Contracts

This project uses the [ThirdWeb contracts](https://thirdweb.com/). If you use the same contracts, it should be plug-n-play to setup your own fork. If you're using different contracts, you'll need to modify the functions in [./app/utils/contractinteraction.ts](https://github.com/lukecd/bears-love-mountains/blob/main/app/utils/contractInteraction.ts)
